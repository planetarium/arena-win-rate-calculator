Hello everyone! I'm excited to introduce Ares, a new third-party website specifically designed for Nine Chronicles players.
Site Link: https://ares.nine-chronicles.dev/

# Overview
Ares is a powerful tool that computes win rates for arena battles and provides detailed insights into arena rankings.
For those who have used the "Ares: mod for NineChronicles Unity Client", you'll be delighted to know that this website extends the same functionalities in a more accessible format.

# Key Features
Unlike the standalone mod, Ares is accessible directly through your web browser.
Simply enter your agent address and choose your avatar to get started. It's that easy!
Ares has been optimized for mobile use, ensuring a seamless experience on your devices. Please note that the site currently supports only the Heimdall framework.

Check out the site and enhance your Nine Chronicles experience today
